										<h2>Black Women In the Media</h2>

									<p>			Media shapes our lives fully. The stories we see on paper and screen shape how we see the world. Representation in media allows us to see ourselves in different characters while opening the doors to our imagination. According to a study, in Essence, the most common portrays of black women included, “ Gold Diggers, Modern Jezebels, Baby Mamas, Uneducated Sisters, Ratchet Women, Angry Black Women, Mean Black Girls, Unhealthy Black Women, and Black Barbies”. The most common characteristics of these stereotypes include being loud, irrational, angry, damaged, hypersexualized, and having a lack of confidence. Similarly, according to the Center for the Study of Women in Television, females played 24% of protagonists in top grossing films and media. In addition, black women comprised 16% of females in media compared to white women playing 70% of the roles. There were also only 32% of films featuring 10 or more female roles while there were 79% of movies with 10 or more male speaking roles.
We unconsciously internalize the stereotypes we see in media because our brain tries to categorize information as efficiently as possible. The stereotypes we internalize is why in studies like “The Doll Test” by Doctor Kenneth and Mamie Clark most kids are biased toward the lighter skin. Even the stereotypes that may be seen as positive can be harmful. For example, the “strong black omen” trope states that black women can endure through anything even though they have limited resources and unfair conditions. The stereotype of a strong black women allows unfair treatment to be allowed upon black women because they are biologically conditioned for a harder life.
Digital blackface is also a large problem in the media. Digital blackface is directly referenced to blackface- when a nonblack performer wears makeup to look black. Digital blackface is the use of online videos and pictures that associate black people with extreme emotions and behaviors. The videos and pictures are often used to represent the struggles we face on a daily basis.
Just because there isn't a large number of movies and tv with black people doesn’t mean there aren’t great ones. I recommend Insecure starring Issa Rae, How To Get Away With Murder, Scandal and A Wrinkle In Time which comes out in March.

1) Get off your phone. By July, we all sometimes feel like we’re dragging through our days, exhausted and not fully focused in our classes. A great way to feel more present is to ditch your phone for a set amount of time every day (start with one hour and work up from there) and instead use that time to nap, read, shower, or really grind through some hard work. Studies show that teens spend an average of five hours a day on their phones and up to nine hours consuming media in some form ­ don’t be a statistic! Designate times of day when you can catch up on Snapchats or Instagram posts and use the rest of your time to get stuff done. You can even get a great app called Moment, which works in the background to track how many minutes you spend on your phone each day. However you choose to make a change, you’re guaranteed to feel more accomplished and centered.
2) Pick a cause and commit yourself to fighting for what’s right. There’s evidently no shortage of things wrong in our world, so choose one and stick to it. Find something you’re passionate about, whether it be climate change, gun control legislation, or animal rights protection, and get involved at the highest level possible. Within Spence, we have so many great programs that work with our local community to effect change on our society. Join Community Service Club or ask for a leadership role in your grade service project. If there’s change you want to see, use the incredible resources Spence has to offer to fight for it.
3) Go to sleeeeeeeeep. After all that activism, (not to mention school!) you’re bound to be tired. Yet studies show that teens are getting an average of about 7 hours of sleep a night. When you compare this to the recommended 8­10 hours, it’s no wonder that the most common complaint heard around school is, “I’m so tired. I barely slept last night.” If you’re tired of hearing or saying this, try three tricks to get better sleep. First, make your bedroom more conducive to sleeping. Invest in a sleep mask, don’t use your computer or phone in bed, and turn on white noise to quiet your mind in the evening. Second, try going to bed earlier and waking up earlier. Since your brain is more efficient in the morning, it’ll take less time to do the same amount of work! Finally, take naps. There’s no use in getting home from a long day of school and working straight through to midnight. Take a break for 20 minutes and get a nap in. You’ll feel refreshed and ready to tackle all your assignments.
4) My last tip is to make time for what matters to you. If that’s staying fit, recruit a friend and go for a jog after school. If it’s maintaining your friendships, buy a friend a coffee and ban schoolwork from your conversation. Stress is normal, but you need to find the
time to refocus yourself, do something fun, and maintain your mental health. Your daily
homework: self­care.
It’s easy to get sucked into a cycle of stress and panic, especially before exams, but there are so many ways to be more present throughout your day that will help you keep your cool in the demanding weeks to come.

										<h2>International Day of the Girl</h2>

									<p>			The United Nations named October 11th International Day of the Girl (also known as International Day of the Girl Child) in 2011. On this day, people who want to help meet with the common objective of gaining rights for girls, and giving them chances for leadership. Another goal of this day is to spread awareness around issues that girls face. Activism groups feel that girls need to be given a chance to address these issues, because they are the ones who can best solve them. They try to give girls a platform to have their voices heard.
		International Day of the Girl was created by an organization called School Girls Unite, which is a group of many students and female leaders, with the purpose of making girls' lives better all over the world. Their initial goal was for the U.N. to create Sustainable Development Goals surrounding important issues of rights such as gender equality and access to basic education for everyone. They wanted to bring the idea of having a Day of the Girl, which was beginning to arise in other countries, to the U.S. The U.N. decided to make it an international event in December of 2011.
		The theme of International Day of the Girl this year was "EmPOWER girls: Before, during, and after conflict." Its goal was to empower girls to fight for their rights, and the rights of others. One of the many important issues addressed this year was creating peace in areas of conflict. Girls living in areas with conflict are 90% more likely not to be in school than girls in areas without conflict, which shows the immense effects of a girl's surroundings on her opportunities. Some other important issues that were discussed this year were protecting indigenous rights and stopping violence against women.

										<h2>Closed Loop Of Education</h2>

									<p>			At private school, we are all guilty of sometimes ignoring the immense gift we’ve been given. In the greatest city in the world, we have the opportunities necessary to become innovators, advocates, and leaders in an ever­changing world. Regardless of our individual background, we are united by an education that will leave us all with knowledge, connections, and passion, years after we graduate.
The next step, however, is to recognize our responsibility to provide every student like ourselves with the ability to succeed, regardless of personal circumstances. In a changing world, education will continue to be the tool for achievement. Yet all too often, students with incredible potential are left out of the closed system of optimal education.
For the sake of brevity, we will only focus on high school education and higher education. While it is untrue to say that private education is the only way to have a good education, it is often an indicator of schools with greater resources and connections to provide to students. In the U.S., the gap between the percentage of all students who are white vs. the percentage of private school students who are white was 15 percentage points in 2016. In New York, it is closer to 19%. As expected, this gap shows that private education is consistently less available to students of color than white students. While many schools, including ours, make a conscious effort in admissions to diversify the student body, many other factors (many of which are financial) play into how accessible this education is.
This trajectory continues into higher education, with even more complicated factors affecting admissions decisions. Many criticize the continued importance of legacy in college admissions, with legacy students on average being twice as likely to gain acceptance to a college than a non­legacy applicant. MIT admissions officer Chris Peterson states, “I personally would not work for a college which had legacy admission because I am not interested in simply reproducing a multigenerational lineage of educated elite.” Even the most competitive universities, who preach their commitment to equal opportunity for every applicant, still report an average 20­50% acceptance rate for legacy applicants. Therefore, while most of these schools are need­blind, eliminating one of the biggest problems in private high school admissions, they still heavily contribute to the closed loop of privilege that exists in the education system.
Evidently, there is a long way to go before education is accessible for all. And until we actively seek this change, we will continue to leave some of the greatest minds of our generation out of the conversation.

										<h2>Women's Right to Vote in New York</h2>

									<p>New York State was a pioneer in the movement that eventually led to women gaining the right to vote. Like the fight for equal pay and equal rights, the fight to ensure that all men and women had the rights enshrined by the U.S Constitution was neither easy nor short. New York hosted the first-ever Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls in 1848. The two pioneers, Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, organized what came to be known as the Seneca Falls Convention. The attendees at that seminal event approved the Declaration of Rights and Sentiment, a document modeled after the Declaration of Independence that advocated for fundamental citizenship rights for women, including the right to vote in elections. The idea of women's voting rights was deemed radical at the time and many voting right activists fought and rallied for decades until they finally gained that fundamental right of citizenship in 1919. On November 6th, 1917, New York led the way as one of the first states in the nation to give women the right to vote. This was over two years before the 19th amendment to the U.S Constitution was adopted, making New York a clear leader in the fight for women's rights  This year we celebrate the 101th anniversary of that major breakthrough in our state, as well as the rich history of New York's female pioneers who led the way in gaining our fundamental rights. </p>
